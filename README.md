Welcome to my AI and Machine Learning Projects repository!
This repository contains all the projects I worked on during the Edunet Foundation's Foundation Course Program, sponsored by Shell.

üõ†Ô∏è Projects:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Water Shortage Risk Prediction

Algorithm Used: Linear Regression
         Description: Predicts water shortage risks based on environmental data.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Water Usage Prediction

Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression (Unsupervised Learning)

Description: Predicts water consumption patterns to promote sustainable water usage.


3Ô∏è‚É£ Potato Leaf Disease Detection System

Algorithm Used: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Description: An image classification model that identifies potato leaf diseases, showcasing deep learning in action.
